    """Calculate the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between sequences.

    This distance is the number of additions, deletions, substitutions,
    and transpositions needed to transform the first sequence into the
    second. Although generally used with strings, any sequences of
    comparable objects will work.

    Transpositions are exchanges of *consecutive* characters; all other
    operations are self-explanatory.

    This implementation is O(N*M) time and O(M) space, for N and M the
    lengths of the two sequences.

    >>> damerau_levenshtein('ba', 'abc')
    2
    >>> damerau_levenshtein('fee', 'deed')
    2

    It works with arbitrary sequences too:
    >>> damerau_levenshtein('abcd', ['b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'e'])
    2

v0.7.1 - 26-Jun-2020

    - Bug fix: restore usage outside of Jupyter, so that Matplotlib window is shown when calling Drawing.draw().


v0.7 - 21-Jun-2020

    - Dropped support for Python 2. Now requires 3.7+.
    - Elements are now subclasses of Element. Previous (dict) element names are translated into
      new class names. Any user-defined elements will need to be converted to classes.
      The `group_elements` function is replaced with `ElementDrawing` class.      
    - Allow `fontsize` or `size` keyword arguments interchangeably in Drawing and add_label
    - Updated flow.Decision to use keyword arguments for labeling decision branches
    - The Ic element label offset parameter changed from `lblofst` to `lofst` 
      to avoid conflict with the main element label.
    - Direct access to Drawing.fig and Drawing.ax are no longer available. Instead, Drawing.draw()
      returns a schemdraw.Figure instance with fig and ax attributes.
    - Implemented Jupyter representation functions for both Drawing and Element classes.

    - New Elements:
        - Coax
        - Triax
        - SwitchDpst
        - SwitchDpdt
        - Relay
        - Optocoupler
        - Arrow

        - Thermistor
        - DiodeShockley
        - PotBox
        - RBoxVar
        - Solar
        - Neon
        - SourceSquare
        - AntennaLoop
        - AntennaLoop2
        - AudioJack
        - Tgate

        - SchmittNot
        - SchmittAnd
        - SchmittNand


v0.6.0, 11-Feb-2020

    - Refactored internals to allow more control over individual components of drawing.
      Should have no effect unless the user is accessing internal attributes of the Element object.
      This also adds the `segments` list to the Element object, which allows finer control over 
      individual bits of the drawing.
    - Updated add_label so that "top" labels should always appear on top, regardless of flip/reverse
    - Swapped the direction of current sources, so that a current source with direction "up" has the
      arrow pointing up.
    - Added "zorder" parameter in the element definition dictionary and `add` method
    - Added `elements.ic` and `elements.multiplexer` functions as replacements to `blackbox` and `mux`.
      These include more functionality such as adjusting indiviudal pin rotation, color, and inverter bubbles.
    - Labels can be placed relative to an anchor position using the `add_label` method. This could be
      useful, for example, in labeling pin numbers on a logic gate or opamp.
    - Added new anchors to OPAMPs for power supply and offset nulls.      
        
    - New Elements:
        - MIC
        - MOTOR

    - Documentation:
        - Upgraded documentation to Sphinx and moved to readthedocs.org at https://schemdraw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
        - Changed preferred import to `import SchemDraw.elements as elm`. Apparently some people still
          use import * with pylab; this suggestion will help avoid conflicts.
